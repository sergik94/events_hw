1. View the list of events with general details.
2. View all event details by clicking on the poster or event title.
3. Add a new event by clicking the Add Event button.
4. Edit an existing event by clicking the Edit button (upper right/left corner).
5. Add multiple ticket categories to each event.
6. Sort events by date and name (default by date)
7. Filter events by title.
